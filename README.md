# PersonalProjects
My first personal git repo for my work
----
Calculator is me trying to learn how to build GUIs in Python using PySimpleGUi
the calculator is designed to;
  - take user input in GUI form
  - provide a series of operations
  - give the user and output based on the their input value and their selected operation

This is a very basic project, and one that is designed to help me familiarise myself once more with Python, Development and some libraries.
